It seems many years ago I dreamed I was able to read English books. But that time I couldn't tell why I wanna do this at all, maybe it would look like intelligent or cool. Of course those naive purposes would never keep me going.

About 2 years ago, I began to learn English seriously and constantly, not for reading books, just for TOEFL. I wanted to go abroad. The previous sentence might look like incomplete since I didn't say what's the purpose of going abroad, yet I didn't know. Pathetically in my first 27 years of life I never had a clear target, but fortunately I got one now, and I am so comforted that I stick to my English learning, it gave me a new world.

Although I've read several(about 10) English books this year, but I always feel there's something absent, a ritual, a milestone? I can't tell clearly. But I clearly remember the first TOEFL listening material I tried to follow, a 251 words article, the record lasts about one and an half minutes, but it took me about 6 hours(spread in 3 days) to follow through it. Today I completely followed through - means I follow the reading of audible book while look at the paperback book - <Eyes wide open>, it took me:

- 18 days and approximately 30 hours.
- Looked up dictionary about 1000 times.

About 80000 words, this time I used 30 hours, instead of 251 words in 6 hours -- 2600 vs 42 !!!

A good start, and I konw this is a trek without ending, so I won't hurry, keep going, see what would happen.
